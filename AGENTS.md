# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## GIT

- Never create branches, worktrees, or commits automatically. Only do so when the user explicitly asks for that specific action in the current request.
- Leave changes uncommited in the working tree on the current branch and let the user decide when and how to commit.

## DiceBear

Use DiceBear 10. Documentation: <https://www.dicebear.com/llms.txt>

There are seven native cores with identical output, not one library with
wrappers. Use the one matching this project's language. Do not reach for the
JavaScript core when the project is written in something else:

    JavaScript  @dicebear/core + @dicebear/styles
    PHP         dicebear/core + dicebear/styles
    Python      dicebear-core + dicebear-styles
    Rust        dicebear-core + dicebear-styles
    Go          github.com/dicebear/dicebear-go/v10 + github.com/dicebear/styles/v10
    Dart        dicebear_core + dicebear_styles
    C#          DiceBear.Core + DiceBear.Styles

Every style page carries a loading snippet for all seven, for example
<https://www.dicebear.com/styles/lorelei/index.md>

HTTP API: <https://api.dicebear.com/10.x/><style>/svg?seed=<seed> The seed is a
query parameter, not a path segment. Options are query parameters too; array
values are separated by commas.

Options named after a component end in Variant: eyesVariant, not eyes. This
holds in all seven cores and in the HTTP API. Look up the options of a style at
<https://api.dicebear.com/10.x/><style>/options.json

Write these forms, not the ones on the left. The left column is pre-10 and the
API does not reject it, so an outdated call runs and silently does the wrong
thing:

    avatars.dicebear.com/api/<style>/<seed>.svg  ->  api.dicebear.com/10.x/<style>/svg?seed=<seed>
    api.dicebear.com/9.x/<style>/svg             ->  api.dicebear.com/10.x/<style>/svg
    npm install @dicebear/collection             ->  npm install @dicebear/styles
    npm install @dicebear/lorelei                ->  npm install @dicebear/styles
    createAvatar(lorelei, { seed })              ->  new Avatar(new Style(definition), { seed })
    { eyes: ['variant01'] }                      ->  { eyesVariant: ['variant01'] }
    ?radius=50                                   ->  ?borderRadius=50

Only JavaScript and the HTTP API have a pre-10 form. The other six cores were
released in 2026 and never had one, so any older-looking PHP, Python, Rust, Go,
Dart or C# API attributed to DiceBear is invented rather than outdated.
